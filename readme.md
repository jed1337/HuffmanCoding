## HuffmanCoding

Huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression

The output from Huffman's algorithm can be viewed as a variable-length code table for encoding a source symbol (such as a character in a file). The algorithm derives this table from the estimated probability or frequency of occurrence (weight) for each possible value of the source symbol. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding)
